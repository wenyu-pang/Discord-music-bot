# Discord-music-bot
For this project, I created a Discord music bot using Python, the discord.py library, and yt_dlp.
The bot can join a voice channel, play music from YouTube links, pause, resume, stop, skip songs, and manage a queue of songs. It also responds to simple text commands like !hello and !test.

Main features:

-!join: Bot joins the user's voice channel.

-!play [YouTube URL or search term]: Adds a song to the queue and plays it.

-!pause / !resume: Pause and resume the current track.

-!skip: Skip to the next song in the queue.

-!clear: Clear the entire song queue.

-!queue: Show the current list of queued songs.

-!leave: Bot leaves the voice channel.

-!hello / !test: Fun text interactions with users.
